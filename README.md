# A Deep Q-Learning algorithm for the game Connect 4

## Desclaimer: This project is still work in progress!!!

The aim of this project is to create an AI that plays reasonably well at the game [Connect 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four). It is based on the [deep Q-learning](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/docs/dqn.pdf) algortithm by DeepMind.

More precisely, the aim is to train two AI that learn by playing against each other. This is an extra complications compared with a traditional Reinforcement Learning setting where there is only one agent that interacts with a static environment and makes the learning process less stable.
